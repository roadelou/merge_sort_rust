# Merge Sort (Rust)

A merge sort implementation for `Vec<f32>`. On my machine, this implementation can generate and sort 10 000 000 floats in 2min43.156s, i.e. sort ~50K floats per seconds :robot:

As a side note, this took me forever to implement because I was trying to keep a functionnal-style as much as possible, and because I didn't figure out what `collect` was doing at first. I really woulnd't recommend Rust for such manipulations, the safety really gets in the way here.
